- 👋 Hi, I’m @geezzeer
- 😁 I'm retired from a long career in communications and several other industries, but always in and around IT.
- 🙄 I'm a self-taught programmer. I started with FORTRAN and moved through C and C++ and I'm currently dabbling in C#.
- 👀 I’m interested in small, more-or-less self contained widgets such as SunUp/SunDown calculations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at a very slow pace.
- 💞️ I’m like to connect with an experienced .Net programmer who'd be willing to look at my code occasionally and offer advice.
- 📫 How to reach me via email at geezzeer@gmail.com
